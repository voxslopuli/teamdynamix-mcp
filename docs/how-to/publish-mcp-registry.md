# Manual MCP Registry Publishing

If the automated GitHub Actions workflow fails or you need to publish server.json manually, follow this fallback runbook.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed
- `@modelcontextprotocol/publisher` CLI installed globally
- Domain ownership verified at [self.agency](https://self.agency)

## Step 1: Install mcp-publisher CLI

```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/publisher@latest
```

## Step 2: Verify server.json

Confirm `docs/public/server.json` exists and has correct values:

```bash
# Verify mcpName matches package.json
jq '.name' docs/public/server.json # Should be: io.github.voxslopuli/teamdynamix-mcp
jq '.packages[0].identifier' docs/public/server.json # Should be: @voxslopuli/teamdynamix-mcp

# Verify version alignment
jq '.version' docs/public/server.json # Should match package.json version
jq '.packages[0].version' docs/public/server.json # Should match package.json version
```

Expected structure:

- `name` matches `package.json.mcpName`
- `version` matches `package.json.version`
- `packages[0].identifier` is `@voxslopuli/teamdynamix-mcp`
- `environmentVariables` includes all required TeamDynamix env vars

## Step 3: Publish server.json

From the repository root:

```bash
# Publish to MCP Registry
mcp-publisher publish docs/public/server.json --domain self.agency
```

Expected output:

```text
✓ Validated server.json
✓ Domain ownership verified: self.agency
✓ Published io.github.voxslopuli/teamdynamix-mcp v0.2.0
```

## Step 4: Verify publication

Confirm:

- Server name: `io.github.voxslopuli/teamdynamix-mcp`
- Version: Matches your published version
- Environment variables documented correctly
- Package listing shows npm transport

Check that your server appears in the MCP Registry:

```bash
# Search for your server (when CLI search is available)
mcp-publisher search io.github.voxslopuli/teamdynamix-mcp

# Or verify via web UI at modelcontextprotocol.io
```

Confirm:

- Server name: `io.github.voxslopuli/teamdynamix-mcp`
- Version: Matches your published version
- Environment variables documented correctly
- Package listing shows npm transport

## Troubleshooting

### Domain ownership not verified

**Error**: `Domain ownership verification failed for self.agency`

**Fix**:

1. Visit [MCP Registry domain verification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/domains)
2. Follow the DNS or TXT record verification steps
3. Wait for propagation (may take up to 24 hours)
4. Retry publish command

### Invalid server.json

**Error**: `server.json validation failed: mcpName does not match package.json`

**Fix**:

1. Run `pnpm build` to sync versions
2. Check `dist/package.json` contains `mcpName` field
3. Verify `server.json.version` matches `package.json.version`

### Auth token invalid

**Error**: `Authentication failed: Invalid MCP_PUBLISHER_TOKEN` (manual/local token flow)

**Fix**:

1. Regenerate domain auth token at MCP Registry dashboard
2. Ensure token is set in `MCP_PUBLISHER_TOKEN` env var
3. Check for trailing spaces or newline in token value

### Version mismatch

**Error**: `Package version X.Y.Z in npm does not match server.json version A.B.C`

**Fix**:

1. Run `npm publish` to push npm package first
2. Wait for npm registry propagation (usually < 1 minute)
3. Retry `mcp-publisher publish docs/public/server.json`

### CI workflow failure

If GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml` fails:

1. Check workflow logs for specific error
2. Confirm OIDC permissions are present (`id-token: write`, `contents: read`)
3. Verify domain ownership is configured for `self.agency`
4. If the failure was in the manual dispatch path, confirm a valid `version` input was provided (for example `1.2.3` or `v1.2.3`)
5. Confirm the selected run ref/commit is the one you intend to release
6. Confirm `docs/public/server.json` is committed to the branch/tag being published
7. Re-run workflow after fixing issue

## Automation notes

- **Automated trigger**: The workflow runs automatically on git tags matching `v*` (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
- **Manual trigger**: Use GitHub Actions UI to run `Release` with a required `version` input (`1.2.3` or `v1.2.3`)
- **Manual run behavior**: The workflow validates/builds/tests the selected ref, derives the release tag from `version`, then publishes npm + GitHub Release + MCP Registry metadata
- **Tag trigger**: Pushing a `v*` tag runs the same workflow and uses that tag as release metadata
- **Publish order**: After CI succeeds, the workflow publishes npm first, then GitHub Release assets/notes, then MCP Registry metadata from `docs/public/server.json`

## Required secrets

For GitHub Actions CI/CD with OIDC:

**No npm token is required**. The workflow publishes to npm using **npm trusted publishing** with GitHub Actions OIDC, and publishes to MCP Registry using OIDC at `self.agency`.

Workflow requirements:

- `id-token: write` permission must be present on the release job
- the npm package must have a trusted publisher configured for this repository/workflow
- no `NPM_TOKEN` secret is required for the GitHub Actions release flow

For manual publishing:

- You must manually authenticate with your domain credentials or use the MCP Registry dashboard to publish server.json directly

## OIDC Authentication

This repository uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) in two places during automated release:

- **npm publish**: GitHub Actions `release.yml` uses npm trusted publishing via OIDC without `NPM_TOKEN`
- **MCP Registry publish**: GitHub Actions `release.yml` authenticates automatically using OIDC without secrets
- **Manual (local)**: Requires domain credentials or dashboard access
- **Security**: OIDC provides short-lived tokens, reducing credential exposure risk
- **Domain verification**: Your domain (`self.agency`) must be verified with the MCP Registry
